# I-thought 'marital' was a typo!

An unfinished test when I first began learning to program, where I wrote a short introduction. Itâ€™s silly, and I hope to continue it sometime.

Fun fact: This is the fiftieth example of Thistle being a nerd. I'm not even going to be coy about it: this is based off of my favorite book, *The Scum Villain's Self-Saving System.* It's not subtle. My first thought when we started working in the console was just "Wow, this is so System from SVSSS-coded..." so I, _obviously,_ had to indulge and make something short.
